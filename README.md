## The Journey Begins
I am a stubborn brazilian gamer ready to give my life to realize my dream: Become rich by only selling brazilian games (yes, I have some mental illnesses). But as a solo entrepeneur I have to create an API to manage the products, staff and the money of your business. Can I succeed or will I fail miserably and drive my game store to bankruptcy?
